Chi-Square Test for Independence on Website Traffic
This program was created as part of a capstone project for Master's in Data Analytics.  

The data was retrieved from:

P. B. (2018). Customer Propensity to Purchase Dataset. [Data set]. Kaggle. 
 https://www.kaggle.com/benpowis/customer-propensity-to-purchase-data 

and represents a day's worth of website traffic on a single website.  

The data lists every possible link that can be accessed on a fictional, eCommerce website.
For each user session, the data records whether an user accessed a link with a 1 for accessed, and 0 for not accessed.

Each session could include a customer purchase.

Chi-Square can be used to determine which links have a relationship wth a purchase.  

However, the relationship may not always be a positive relationship (correlation does not prove causation).  

Further analysis would be needed to determine the nature of the relationship.

This program would be good for tracking website traffic to determine if there are deficiencies in the 
website that cause a user to not complete the purchase or if there are certain elements of the website that
drive a purchase.
